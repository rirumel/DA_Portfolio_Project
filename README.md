# DA_Portfolio_Project
This repository will showcase all the projects that I had done in order to become a Data Analyst.

## Project 1:

Here I used the Covid Dataset which is downloaded from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

After downloading the dataset, I split it into two datasets: 1) Covid Deaths 2) Covid Vaccination. Then my aim was to explore the data using SQL Queries. In order for that I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18 and Microsoft SQL Server 2019. Since MSSMS supports excel files and not CSV files, So before importing the datasets I had to convert them from CSV to XLSX. After importing the datasets, I wrote different queries depending on different types of relationship that I wanted to see in the data. Please look into my project file to better understand about the queries I used in this project. Before every query, I made clear comments which would help you to understand the purpose of writing that query. At the end of the project, I also created a view that would help me to use and visualize a special set of data in the future that I created using a query.
